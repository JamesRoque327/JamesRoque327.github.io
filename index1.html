                        <h2>Why is it important to have a Bag?</h2>
                        <p>Bags have been around for ages and they have been 
                            so due to its importance in the daily life of a person.
                            Both men and women have found uses on why they are carrying their own bag to school,
                            work, or any other activity there is. They are both for function and vanity,
                            especially for women who consider bags as one of their most essential accessories.
                            In this busy and outgoing world, you can easily put everything you need to survive 
                            in a bag and go on your way throughout the day. You can hardly look for an alternative 
                            that will serve the same purpose as bags. You can find the simplest one out there to the 
                            most sophisticated one and they would still serve the same function. 
                        </p>

                        <h2>What is a Adventure Bag?</h2>
                        <p>The Adventure bag is a Stubble and Co backpack we’ve used as an amazing one 
                            bag travel pack for more than two years. This extremely lightweight bag has a
                             clamshell design with 9 compartments for organized packing. Sometimes there are 
                             too many features on travel bags, but the Adventure does it right. And it’s done 
                             with eco-friendly style.

                            Maxing out the allowable size for carry-on baggage, the design includes smart 
                            check-in features too. But it’s a bag you can also use as weekender as well as for 
                            camping. It also works really well with packing cubes.
                            
                            We took the Adventure bag on many activities in a lot of different places, 
                            taking up Stubble’s challenge of “do anything anywhere” in order to find this 
                            bag’s limits. This is what we found out.

                        <h2>Why Trendy Bags are for Fashion</h2>
                        <p>Bags are one of the most important accessories for carrying essential items. 
                            Along with necessity, beautiful and smart bags also double the style. 
                            In keeping with the times, there have been many changes in fashion. 
                            Its role is always unique, including university classes, offices or outings. 
                            Besides, one can present herself more stylishly by using a tasteful bag. 
                            Party or casual look is an essential part of every occasion. 
                            Not only according to the occasion, but also depending on the type of clothing 
                            they carry the bag. A look is not complete without designer clothes, trendy jewelry 
                            and a matching bag. Again, one can express their personality or taste through the 
                            bag in their hand.
